# WordPress Widget Templates

***Work in Progress***

These are a collection of widget templates for use with WordPress (WP)

These widget templates recreate the following standard WP widgets
for use with Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies
* Date Archive Widget
* Recent Posts Widget
* Category (Taxonomy) Widget
* Tag Cloud (Taxonomy) Widget

In addition to the standard WP widgets there is also an Authors Widget.

Besides just creating the widgets, these templates also will create all the necessary rewrite rules
when they are needed, for example date archives specific to a post type. Also included in each template
is a function that will automatically create a Widget Area in WP that matches the post type.

See instructions for using these widget templates in each of the completed templates.
